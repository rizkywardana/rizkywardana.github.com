================

When I decided to learn Python, I was looking for online tutorial that easy to
grasp. I found following free books helped a lot:

- [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org)
- [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)

These two books are easy to understand. You need to avoid copy-paste whenever
code is presented. This will help you to familiarize Python syntax.

After that I was looking for code convention in Python. I found
[David's Goodger' Presentation](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/presentation.html) is much enjoyable
to read than [PEP 8 Guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). But I
recommend you to read both.

So what's next? Of course, type more code in Python. I started by writing
solution for simple problem in Python. Simple problems can be your homework or
known algorithm that you can find in Wikipedia. You already know code
convention, but you need to know common structure for Python project. To get
common structure that comforts best-practice, I searched popular Python-projects
in Github, found some awesome projects and trying to understand the structure.

I know this will take time, months or even years. But there's no shortcut to
be a Python's Guru.

I hope this post will help you to start learning Python. Happy learning!
