Hello World! This is my first post on my Jekyll-powered blog. What motivated me to blog like a hacker was, of course, "Tom Preston-Werner's post":http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html. My blog is cloned from Tom's blog with tweaked layout and styles. So here's what I did to get my blog up:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir rizkywardana.github.com
$ cd rizkywardana.github.com
$ git clone https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com .
$ rm -rf _site
$ rm -rf _posts/*
{% endhighlight %}

After that, I created "rizkywardana.github.com repository":https://github.com/rizkywardana/rizkywardana.github.com, added remote origin, as usual, on my local repo, and tweaked the layout and stylesheet. If you need to tweak more, jump into "Jekyll wiki":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki.

So what's I'm going to write on this blog? Well, I'm thinking to write about my experiences learning Python and algorithm.
